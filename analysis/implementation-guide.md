# Agent OS Enhancement Implementation Guide

## Quick Start

This guide provides practical steps to implement the enhanced planning and specification workflows in Agent OS.

## Phase 1: Core Enhancements (Week 1-2)

### 1.1 Add Requirements Discovery Workflow

**Files to create:**
```
/instructions/core/requirements-discovery.md
/commands/requirements-discovery.md
/claude-code/agents/requirements-analyst.md
```

**Integration points:**
- Update `plan-product.md` to check for discovery document
- Modify `create-spec.md` to use discovery context
- Add command trigger in main command registry

**Implementation steps:**
```bash
# 1. Create the requirements discovery instruction
cp analysis/enhanced-workflows/requirements-discovery.md \
   instructions/core/requirements-discovery.md

# 2. Create command wrapper
cat > commands/requirements-discovery.md << 'EOF'
---
description: Intelligent requirements discovery through contextual questioning
command: requirements-discovery
aliases: [discover, gather-requirements, analyze-needs]
---
# Requirements Discovery Command

Triggers the intelligent requirements discovery workflow.

## Usage
```
/requirements-discovery
/discover
```

## Process
Executes: @.agent-os/instructions/core/requirements-discovery.md
EOF

# 3. Create the subagent
cat > claude-code/agents/requirements-analyst.md << 'EOF'
# Requirements Analyst Agent

Specializes in eliciting and analyzing requirements through intelligent questioning.

## Capabilities
- Project type classification
- Domain-specific questioning
- Progressive requirement refinement
- Risk and constraint identification
EOF
```

### 1.2 Enhance Specification Creation

**Files to modify:**
```
/instructions/core/create-spec.md
```

**Key changes:**
1. Replace Step 3 with intelligent questioning framework
2. Add specification templates for different feature types
3. Include validation and completeness checks
4. Add feedback capture mechanism

**Example enhancement:**
```xml
<!-- Replace existing Step 3 in create-spec.md -->
<step number="3" subagent="requirements-analyst" name="intelligent_requirements_clarification">

### Step 3: Intelligent Requirements Clarification

<question_framework>
  LOAD project_type FROM context OR determine FROM feature_description
  SELECT questions FROM framework_library FOR project_type

  <adaptive_questioning>
    PRESENT questions in logical groups
    ANALYZE responses for patterns
    GENERATE follow-up questions based on:
      - Ambiguity indicators
      - Risk factors
      - Technical complexity
      - Integration needs
  </adaptive_questioning>
</question_framework>

<question_categories>
  <functional>
    - User flows and interactions
    - Data requirements
    - Business rules
    - Integration points
  </functional>

  <non_functional>
    - Performance expectations
    - Security requirements
    - Scalability needs
    - Compliance constraints
  </non_functional>

  <edge_cases>
    - Error scenarios
    - Boundary conditions
    - Concurrent operations
    - Failure recovery
  </edge_cases>
</question_categories>

</step>
```

## Phase 2: Question Frameworks (Week 2-3)

### 2.1 Create Question Library

**File structure:**
```
/standards/questions/
  ├── web-app.yaml
  ├── mobile-app.yaml
  ├── api-service.yaml
  ├── data-pipeline.yaml
  ├── domains/
  │   ├── e-commerce.yaml
  │   ├── saas.yaml
  │   ├── healthcare.yaml
  │   └── fintech.yaml
  └── patterns/
      ├── authentication.yaml
      ├── payment.yaml
      ├── integration.yaml
      └── data-processing.yaml
```

**Example: web-app.yaml**
```yaml
project_type: web_app
categories:
  initial:
    - question: "Is this a public-facing or internal application?"
      follow_up_if_public:
        - "SEO requirements?"
        - "Expected traffic?"
      follow_up_if_internal:
        - "Number of users?"
        - "SSO integration?"

  technical:
    - question: "Single-page application (SPA) or traditional multi-page?"
      follow_up_if_spa:
        - "Client-side routing?"
        - "State management approach?"
      follow_up_if_multi:
        - "Server-side rendering?"
        - "Session management?"

  features:
    - question: "User authentication required?"
      follow_up_if_yes:
        - "Social login?"
        - "Two-factor authentication?"
        - "Password requirements?"
        - "Session timeout?"

smart_defaults:
  if_mentioned:
    - keyword: "dashboard"
      assume: ["data visualization", "real-time updates", "filtering"]
    - keyword: "marketplace"
      assume: ["payment processing", "user ratings", "search"]
```

### 2.2 Implement Question Selection Logic

**File: /instructions/core/helpers/question-selector.md**
```markdown
# Question Selection Helper

## Logic Flow

1. **Classify Project**
   ```
   INPUT: user_description
   ANALYZE: keywords, patterns
   OUTPUT: project_type, domain, complexity
   ```

2. **Load Base Questions**
   ```
   LOAD: /standards/questions/{project_type}.yaml
   MERGE: /standards/questions/domains/{domain}.yaml
   ```

3. **Apply Intelligence**
   ```
   FOR each user_response:
     IF contains(risk_indicators):
       ADD risk_questions
     IF contains(integration_keywords):
       ADD integration_questions
     IF contains(scale_indicators):
       ADD performance_questions
   ```

4. **Prioritize Questions**
   ```
   SORT by:
     1. Critical (blocking)
     2. Important (affects architecture)
     3. Helpful (optimizations)
     4. Optional (nice-to-know)
   ```
```

## Phase 3: Feedback Loops (Week 3-4)

### 3.1 Add Iteration Points

**Modify workflow connections:**
```yaml
workflow_connections:
  forward:
    plan-product → create-spec → create-tasks → execute-tasks

  feedback:
    execute-tasks → create-spec:
      trigger: "requirement unclear"
      action: "refine specification"

    create-spec → plan-product:
      trigger: "scope change"
      action: "update roadmap"

    execute-tasks → plan-product:
      trigger: "technical blocker"
      action: "revise architecture"
```

### 3.2 Implement Specification Updates

**File: /instructions/core/update-spec.md**
```markdown
# Update Specification Rules

## Trigger Conditions

1. **During Implementation**
   - Ambiguity discovered
   - Technical constraint found
   - Better solution identified

2. **During Testing**
   - Edge case uncovered
   - Performance issue
   - Security concern

## Update Process

1. **Capture Feedback**
   ```
   RECORD: issue description
   CLASSIFY: type and severity
   PROPOSE: solution options
   ```

2. **Update Specification**
   ```
   MODIFY: affected sections
   ADD: decision rationale
   INCREMENT: version number
   LOG: change history
   ```

3. **Propagate Changes**
   ```
   IF affects tasks:
     UPDATE: tasks.md
   IF affects roadmap:
     UPDATE: roadmap.md
   IF affects architecture:
     NOTIFY: team for review
   ```
```

## Phase 4: Testing & Refinement (Week 4-5)

### 4.1 Test Scenarios

Create test projects to validate enhancements:

1. **Simple Web App**
   - Test basic question flow
   - Verify appropriate depth
   - Check generated specs

2. **Complex Integration**
   - Test adaptive questioning
   - Verify edge case discovery
   - Validate technical depth

3. **Domain-Specific (e.g., E-commerce)**
   - Test domain detection
   - Verify assumption application
   - Check compliance questions

### 4.2 Metrics Collection

**Track effectiveness:**
```yaml
metrics:
  requirement_completeness:
    measure: "% of requirements discovered before implementation"
    target: "> 85%"

  specification_changes:
    measure: "Number of spec updates during implementation"
    target: "< 3 per feature"

  question_relevance:
    measure: "User rating of question usefulness"
    target: "> 4.0/5.0"

  time_to_clarity:
    measure: "Time from idea to approved spec"
    target: "< 2 hours for medium complexity"
```

## Integration Examples

### Example 1: Web Application Planning

```bash
# User initiates discovery
/requirements-discovery

# System response:
"Let me help you gather requirements for your project. First, I need to understand what type of project this is.

Please tell me:
1. What are you building? (brief description)
2. Who will use it? (target audience)
3. What's the main problem it solves?"

# User: "I'm building a task management app for remote teams"

# System analyzes and continues:
"I understand you're building a task management application for remote teams. This appears to be a B2B web application in the collaboration domain.

Let me ask some specific questions to better understand your requirements:

**Core Functionality**
1. Will teams need separate workspaces, or will all users share one environment?
2. What types of tasks need to be managed? (simple todos, complex projects, or both?)
3. Do you need real-time collaboration features?

**Team Features**
4. How will teams be structured? (flat, hierarchical, or flexible?)
5. What permission levels do you need? (viewer, contributor, admin, custom?)

**Remote Team Specific**
6. Multiple timezone support needed?
7. Asynchronous communication features? (comments, mentions, notifications?)
8. Integration with video conferencing tools?"
```

### Example 2: Adaptive Specification

```markdown
# After requirements gathered, create adaptive spec:

## Feature Specification: Team Task Assignment

> Specification Type: workflow_feature
> Complexity: MEDIUM
> Risk Level: LOW
> Confidence: 85%

## Quick Summary
Enable team leads to assign tasks to team members with automatic notification and workload balancing.

## Discovered Requirements
From our discussion, I've identified these key needs:
- Workload visibility before assignment
- Skill-based task matching (you mentioned this when discussing team efficiency)
- Notification preferences per user (discovered through timezone discussion)

## Edge Cases Identified
Through intelligent questioning, we discovered:
1. Assignee on vacation → Route to backup or queue
2. Overloaded team member → Warning with reallocation suggestion
3. Task requires multiple people → Support co-assignment

## Open Questions for Iteration
- [ ] Should task reassignment require approval? (Decide during implementation)
- [ ] How to handle partial completion before reassignment? (Test and refine)
```

## Conclusion

This implementation guide provides a practical path to transform Agent OS from a rigid, linear system to an intelligent, adaptive development assistant. The phased approach allows for incremental improvements while maintaining system stability.

The key to success is starting with the requirements discovery enhancement, which immediately improves the quality of all downstream processes. From there, each enhancement builds on the previous, creating a compound improvement in the overall workflow effectiveness.
